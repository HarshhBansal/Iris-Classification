## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample having four features and one of three species labels. The dataset is included in the `datasets` module of `scikit-learn`, so it does not require a separate download.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification
```

## Usage

To explore the dataset and run the classification models, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `Iris_Classification.ipynb` notebook to see the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Models

The following classification algorithms are implemented and evaluated in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Each model is trained and evaluated using the same training and testing datasets to ensure a fair comparison.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

The evaluation results are displayed in the notebook and can be used to compare the performance of different models.

## Results

The results section of the notebook includes visualizations and tables that summarize the performance of each model. The key findings and best-performing model(s) are highlighted.
